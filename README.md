# FIOgui
Gui for the fio tool found online

This FIO gui is built to allow low level testers to run IO traffic to drives without the need to use
command line arguments or config files.

The current gui version is a work and progess and some functionality is limited.

Fio resides in a git repo, the canonical place is:

	git://git.kernel.dk/fio.git

When inside a corporate firewall, git:// URL sometimes does not work.
If git:// does not work, use the http protocol instead:

	http://git.kernel.dk/fio.git

Snapshots are frequently generated and :file:`fio-git-*.tar.gz` include the git
meta data as well. Other tarballs are archives of official fio releases.
Snapshots can download from:

	http://brick.kernel.dk/snaps/



I have also included an executable for quicker access to the fio tool.
